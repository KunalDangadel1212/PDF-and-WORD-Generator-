## Version History
1.0.0 - Initial release

## Additional Notes
        - This application is currently under development.
        - Future plans may include:
            1. Implementing actual product management features. 
            2. Enhancing the UI
            3. Adding more robust testing
 ## Additional Features Planned:

  # 1. Exception Handling:
    Implement a global exception handler using @ControllerAdvice to gracefully handle errors and provide informative responses.
    Use specific exception types (e.g., ProductNotFoundException) to convey meaningful error messages to the client.
    
  # 2. PDF and Word File Generation:
    Integrate a library like Apache POI or OpenPDF to create and export PDF and Word documents from product data.
    Provide endpoints to trigger file generation and download.
   
  # 3. CRUD Operations:
    Implement full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing products.
    Use Spring Data JPA repositories for interacting with the database.
   
  # 4. Data Security:
    Store sensitive data (e.g., passwords) securely using hashing and encryption techniques.
    Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect data access.
    Consider using Spring Security for comprehensive security features.
   
  # 5. MySQL Database Integration:
    Configure Spring Data JPA to connect to a MySQL database.
    Create necessary tables and entities for product data storage.

  # 6. Client-Server Communication:
    Design RESTful API endpoints using Spring MVC to handle client requests and provide responses in JSON or XML format.

  # 7. Additional Features:
     User Management: Implement user registration, login, and role-based access control.
     Search and Filtering: Enable users to search and filter products based on various criteria.
     Reporting and Analytics: Generate reports and visualize product data for insights.
     Integration with Other Systems: Explore integration with external services (e.g., payment gateways, email) for enhanced functionality.           

 ## Development Roadmap:

    1. Exception Handling: Implement global and specific exception handling.
    2. File Generation: Integrate library and create endpoints for PDF and Word generation.
    3. CRUD Operations: Implement CRUD functionality using Spring Data JPA.
    4. MySQL Integration: Configure Spring Data JPA to connect to MySQL.
    5. Data Security: Implement authentication, authorization, and data protection measures.
    6. REST API Development: Design RESTful API endpoints for client-server communication.
    7. Additional Features: Prioritize and implement extra features as needed.
